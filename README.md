## What is an Audio Bible

An audio bible is a script of all the sound effects, dialogue and music that appear in a game and the design and direction of all those features.

### Audio Pillars
---
Audio Pillars are filters that describe the aesthetics of the game audio so designers can create their compositions based on the same things.
They usually choose from 3 to 5 pillars, these have to describe emotions, settings, moods... They must be able to make designers understand how their creations should be.

On [this](https://www.voices.com/blog/video-game-voice-over-sample-script-sound-stories/) website you can find portions of the audio bible, in this case they are dialogues.

### Audio Formats

For all the Sound Effects and Dialogues you should use WAV format:
